    <br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>That in the event any product delivery is delayed or is returned from its destination on your account

incurred by the Company for re-delivery of the product(s) shall be borne by you.</li><br>

<li>You will provide authentic and true information in all instances where any information is requested of you. The Company reserves the right to confirm 
and validate the information and other details provided by you at any point of time.</li><br>
<li>If at any time, the information provided by you is found to be false or inaccurate (wholly or partly),

</ol><br>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u><mark>GST effect on Delivery</mark></u></h1>
<ol>
<li>As our nation welcomes the ‘One Nation, One Tax’’ initiative, effective from July 1st 2017, we, at
E-GROCERY, also welcome this change by making our processes fully compliant with GST.</li><br>
<li>We guarantee you that we still will get you the lowest prices on all your items. Moreover, 
your orders will be fulfilled as usual and in line with the GST guidelines.</li><br>
<li>What are the changes you can expect at our end?: Since the government has exempted certain goods from GST, you will receive invoices for them separately.
 Which means that your order will now be broken down into 3 components:<br>
<ul><br>
<li>At the delivery, our field executive will hand over a delivery statement, 
listing down all the items you have ordered.</li><br>
<li>A Delivery Statement for you to check all the items you’ve ordered.</li><br>
<li>A Tax Invoice showing all the items that have been taxed.</li><br>
<li>A Bill of Supply.</li><br>
</ul><br>
We assure you that you will receive all the GST benefits and lower priced items, as always from Grofers. If you still have any questions,
 please feel free to reach out to us .
